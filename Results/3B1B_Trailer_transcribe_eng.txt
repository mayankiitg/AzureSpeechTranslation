Either welcome to three blue, one Brown. So I make videos that animate math for a lot of them. I just try to find something kind of interesting or thought provoking, not necessarily in progression of subjects that a student would see in school to see what I mean there. Check out some the recommended playlist. Some of the channel though is more directly targeted at people actually trying to learn a commonly taught subject.For an example of what I mean there, check out the essence of linear algebra series that I did. I'll always be working on some other essence of series like this, so stay posted for more.Now when I see that these videos animate math on the one hand, I mean that very directly things are explained with moving visuals, an anthropromorphic kind of cartoonish pie creatures. But my hope here is that they animate math in another, more literal sense of giving life to the subject.Math kind of gets a bad rap for being abstruse and inhuman, and let's face it, a lot of it is symbol heavy and can be introduced in a pretty unmotivated way. But the fact is good math is nothing less than art.I'm getting a lot of you out that feeling when you rap your mind around a really clever argument, and it's got that very unique flavor of satisfaction. And same goes for re understanding something familiar, but in a novel or unexpected light.Here I'm just trying to do my part to share feelings like those with more people.So take a look at some of the videos here and if you want to stay posted about new stuff or to just see new videos rather than this trailer whenever you come back to the page, consider subscribing.
